  <p>Why addons for an addon?</p>

  <p>
    There is a lot of room for customization and new functionality in ember-leaflet. However, that functionality may not
    be desirable to be included in every ember-leaflet project, or it may just be too specific for a certain scenario.
    Leaflet plugins are good candidates for ember-leaflet addons.

  <p>
    This concept follows the lead of the great [ember-power-select](http://www.ember-power-select.com) and
    [ember-cli-deploy](http://ember-cli.github.io/ember-cli-deploy/).
